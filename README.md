# Zomato Data Analysis: Exploring Restaurant Trends and Consumer Behavior

## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing Zomato restaurant data to uncover trends and insights about restaurant performance, consumer behavior, and ratings. By conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), the goal is to identify patterns, including restaurant categories, ratings, spending habits, and preferences related to online vs offline ordering.

### Key Insights:
- The majority of restaurants fall under the **dining category**.
- **Dining restaurants** have received the most votes.
- The majority of restaurants have ratings ranging from **3.5 to 4**.
- **Couples** tend to spend an average of **300 rupees** on meals.
- **Offline orders** generally receive lower ratings than **online orders**.
- **Dining restaurants** primarily accept **offline orders**, while **cafes** tend to receive more **online orders**. This indicates that people prefer to order in person at restaurants but prefer online ordering at cafes.

## Project Structure

### Data Collection & Preprocessing
- **Data Collection**: The dataset is sourced from Zomato, containing information about restaurants such as ratings, votes, order types (online/offline), categories (e.g., dining, cafe), and average order spending.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data by handling missing values, converting data types, and normalizing values for analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Restaurant Categories**: Analyzing the distribution of restaurants across different categories (e.g., dining, cafes).
- **Votes Analysis**: Identifying the restaurants with the maximum votes, and the relationship between votes and ratings.
- **Ratings Distribution**: Investigating the distribution of ratings and identifying the average rating trends for various categories.
- **Order Spending Analysis**: Analyzing the average spending by couples and comparing it with other customer types.
- **Online vs Offline Orders**: Analyzing the mode of orders (online/offline) and their correlation with ratings.

### Key Findings:
- **Dining restaurants** are the most common category, receiving the highest number of votes.
- Restaurants generally receive ratings between **3.5 and 4**.
- **Couples** tend to spend **300 rupees** on average.
- **Offline orders** tend to receive lower ratings compared to **online orders**, suggesting that the experience for customers ordering in-person at restaurants is different from those ordering online at cafes.
- **Dining restaurants** predominantly accept **offline orders**, while **cafes** tend to receive more **online orders**.
